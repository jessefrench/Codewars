## Daily Code Challenges
I like to complete at least one challenge from [Codewars](https://codewars.com) every day to keep my mind sharp. This is where I push my code.

## The P.R.E.P. Method
Recently I've started using something called The P.R.E.P. Method to solve my coding challenges. It stands for Parameters, Returns, Examples, and Pseudo code. It's a great way to quickly break down a problem to better understand what needs to happen. I will provide an example below:

```javascript
// Parameters: 
// Returns: 
// Examples: 
// Pseudo code:

function example(){
  // do this
  
  // then this
  
  // and return this
  
}
```

Sometimes coding challenges can be overwhelming with the amount of information they throw at you, but using this method allows me to focus in on the most important parts.
